Hey there! I’m Constanza 👋🏼 

I'm generally interested in conversational agents, so specifically anything around NLU (grounding and reasoning), knowledge representations, and generation. I also enjoy learning about psychology and cognitive sciences.

Here you can find posts that I do randomly. Most of them (if not all) will be summaries of papers I read and they will contain a "Depth" tag that ranges between 1 to 5, where 1 means I have barely skimmed the paper, and 5 means I understand almost everything about the paper ([credits to the labeling](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes#2019-rlil-papers)).

You can check my resume [here](../assets/files/Resume_Constanza_Fierro.pdf)
