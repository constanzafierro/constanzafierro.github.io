Hi! I’m Constanza 👋🏼

I'm a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen in the [CoAStal NLP group](https://coastalcph.github.io/). Previous to that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Youtube in the Paris office, and I studied Computer Science at the University of Chile.

I'm generally interested in knowledge representations and reasoning, multilinguality, and interpretability to build more reliable models. I also enjoy learning about psychology and cognitive sciences. Non work related, I really enjoy running, hiking, cooking, taking photos, and exploring new places.
