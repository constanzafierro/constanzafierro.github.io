Hi! I‚Äôm Constanza üëãüèº

I‚Äôm a last year PhD student at the University of Copenhagen, supervised by [Anders S√∏gaard](https://anderssoegaard.github.io/) in the [CoAStal NLP group](https://coastalcph.github.io/). During my PhD I was lucky to do internships at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in the language understanding team, and at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) in the Siri Understanding team. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer at Google, scaling ML classifiers development at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) in the Paris office. Previous to that, I completed my engineering degree in Computer Science at the University of Chile.

I'm generally interested in knowledge representations and reasoning, multilinguality, and interpretability to build more reliable models. I also enjoy learning about psychology, philosophy and cognitive sciences. Non work related, I really enjoy running, hiking, cooking, taking photos, and exploring new places.
