I"Í<p>Hey there! Iâ€™m constanza ğŸ‘‹ğŸ¼â€¨</p>

<p>Here you can find posts that I do randomly to hopefully contribute to our community.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m generally interested in conversational agents, so specifically in anything around NLU (grounding and reasoning), knowledge retrieval, and generation. I also enjoy learning about psychology and cognitive sciences.</p>
