I"j<p>Hi! I’m Constanza 👋🏼</p>

<p>I’m a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen in the <a href="https://coastalcph.github.io/">CoAStal NLP group</a>. Previous to that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Youtube in the Paris office, and I studied Computer Science at the University of Chile.</p>

<p>I’m generally interested in knowledge representations and reasoning, multilinguality, and interpretability to build more reliable models. I also enjoy learning about psychology and cognitive sciences. Non work related, I really enjoy running, hiking, cooking, taking photos, and exploring new places.</p>
