I"Ş<p>Hey there! Iâ€™m Constanza ğŸ‘‹ğŸ¼â€¨</p>

<p>Here you can find posts that I do randomly. Most of them (if not all) will be summaries of papers I read, these are labeled from 1-5 where 5 means I have barely skimmed it, and 1 means I feel confident that I understand almost everything about the paper (<a href="https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes#2019-rlil-papers">credits to this labeling</a>).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m generally interested in conversational agents, so specifically in anything around NLU (grounding and reasoning), knowledge retrieval, and generation. I also enjoy learning about psychology and cognitive sciences.</p>
